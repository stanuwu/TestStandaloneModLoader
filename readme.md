### WIP
> This Project tries to be a standalone version of https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx with limited features.
> It should be able to load its own gameobject and monobehavoir into a unity game during runtime.
> A lot of code is taken from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx, credit goes to them!
